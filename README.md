# Cars Lab

This lab explores various class construction facilities provided by Python.

To construct this class, I had to use the tests cases provided t0 incrementally build the class structure.

Based on the provided test, the following class structure was built:

    --------------------------------
    Car
    --------------------------------
    name : string
    model : string
    num_of_doors : integer
    num_of_wheel : integer
    speed : integer
    is_saloon() : boolean
    drive(new_speed: int): Car
    ---------------------------------
    

## Why am I doing this?

This labs are part of the Andela boot-camp set of programming assignments, which am currently participating in.

Feel free to comment on the code or ask any questions about the boot-camp.
